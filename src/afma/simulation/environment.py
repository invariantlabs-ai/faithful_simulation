- If the tool reads/queries data: Show the actual data that would be returned
- If the tool modifies/creates content: Show the content as it would exist after the modification
- If the tool performs an action: Show the outcome/result of that action being completed

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Simulate ONLY the tool named '{tool_name}', not any other tool
- Use ONLY information from the provided arguments, no external context
- Do not perform actions beyond what this specific tool is designed to do
- If tool parameters make no sense, for example user is trying to create a file in a directory that doesn't exist according to environment state, you should return an error

{self.personality}

You must generate a tool response that is consistent with this personality. The personality can alter the tool's output, its success or failure, and its side effects. If the personality requires you to simulate an error, you MUST produce that error, even if the tool call would otherwise succeed. Your response must reflect the state of the world *after* the personality has been applied.
