No new issue should be opened; the existing issue gets updated.\n\n**Processing Outcome:**\n- The repository already has the required maintenance update on issue #1, with the latest status block and correct labeling already in place.\n- No further immediate update or action is necessary regarding maintenance on the repository.\n\nIf you want to take other actions on the repository or need a more detailed breakdown of any specific file or content, let me know!",
