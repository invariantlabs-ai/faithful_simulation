This RFC proposes UX and API improvements to make conflicts clearer and safer to resolve.\\n\\nProblems observed\\n- Conflicts are surfaced late and the diff context is limited.\\n- It\u2019s hard to tell which side (local vs. remote) changed what and why.\\n- Merges can accidentally override unrelated preferences.\\n\\nProposal\\n1. Pre-merge preview panel\\n   - Side-by-side view with three-way merge context (Base / Local / Remote).\\n   - Inline explanations for common conflicts (e.g., deprecated settings, renamed keys).\\n2. Conflict heuristics and safe defaults\\n   - Prefer non-destructive merges for lists (e.g., extensions) with dedupe.\\n   - Highlight risky overrides in red with explicit confirmation.\\n3.

API surface for extensions\\n   - Proposed events: onWillSync, onConflictDetected, onDidResolveConflict.\\n   - Proposed commands: workbench.sync.previewConflicts, workbench.sync.exportBundle.\\n\\nOpen questions\\n- Should we allow per-setting conflict strategies (keep-local, keep-remote, merge)?\\n- How should we handle secrets or machine-scoped settings during merges?\\n- What telemetry is minimally necessary to assess success/failure without collecting sensitive data?\\n\\nAlternatives considered\\n- Auto-resolve all conflicts with timestamps (rejected: too risky).\\n- Force manual JSON edits (status quo; poor UX for most users).\\n\\nCall for feedback\\n- Please share conflict scenarios you\u2019ve hit, especially with multi-profile or multi-branch workflows.\\n- Interested in early testing? Reply here with your platform and typical sync setup.\\n\\nSuccess criteria\\n- 30% reduction in conflict-related churn (retries, toggling sync off/on).\\n- 20% increase in successful first-attempt resolutions in experiment.\\n\\nNext steps\\n- Gather scenarios and edge cases from the community.\\n- Prototype the preview panel and conflict heuristics behind a feature flag.\\n- Iterate on the API proposal with extension authors.\\n\",\n  \"html_url\": \"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/discussions/1234\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2024-08-12T15:27:43Z\",\n  \"discussion_category\": {\n    \"name\": \"Ideas\"\n  }\n}"

Pre-merge preview panel for a better side-by-side conflict view.\n  2. Smarter default conflict handling and clear, risk-highlighted UI.\n  3. Audit trails and easy restore points.\n  4. New API events for extension authors.\n- The team is soliciting feedback, scenarios, and edge cases\u2014especially from those using multi-profile or multi-branch workflows.\n\nWould you like to:\n- See or add comments already posted in that discussion?\n- Draft a feedback reply or contribute your scenario?\n- Explore or dissect specific RFC proposals (UI, API, etc.)?\n- Summarize or compare community feedback so far?\n\nLet me know which direction you'd like to go, or if you want step-by-step guidance for participating in or acting on this discussion!",
