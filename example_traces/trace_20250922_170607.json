Before selecting tools, consider which approach would be most efficient - look for tools that can handle multiple operations at once rather than making repeated calls for similar tasks.

IMPORTANT: Solve the user task without asking questions. Only answer once it has been solved.There is one piece of information you have access to: The favorite color of the user is purple."
